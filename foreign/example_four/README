The purpose of this FLI test example is to illustrate how to create and
use foreign subprograms.

The files are organized as follows:

foreignsp.c         The FLI code for the foreign subprograms.

foreignsp.exports   An export file to export symbols from foreignsp.c for
                    the IBM platform.

foreignsp.vhd       The VHDL code for the example.  The package contains the
                    VHDL prototypes for the two subprograms.  The test
                    architecture calls the foreign subprograms from within
                    a VHDL process.

runtest.aix         A script to run the test on the 32-bit IBM RS6000 platform.

runtest.bat         A script to run the test in a DOS shell on the Windows
                    platform.

runtest.hp64        A script to run the test on the 64-bit HP-UX platform.

runtest.hpu         A script to run the test on the 32-bit HP-UX platform.

runtest.lnx         A script to run the test on the 32-bit Linux platform.

runtest.rs64        A script to run the test on the 64-bit IBM RS6000 platform.

runtest.ss5         A script to run the test on the 32-bit Sun Solaris platform.

runtest.ss5v9       A script to run the test on the 64-bit Sun Solaris platform.

runtest.win         A script to run the test in an MKS shell on the Windows
                    platform.

runtest_win.do      A do file to run the test from a ModelSim command line
                    on the Windows platform.

vsim.do             A vsim dofile to run the simulation and display results.

NOTE: Each runtest script should be edited to run the appropriate
      compiler and linker for your system and to point to your
      modeltech installation for the include files.
