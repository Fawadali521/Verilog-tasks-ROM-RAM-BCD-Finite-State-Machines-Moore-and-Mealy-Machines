The purpose of this FLI test example is to illustrate how to read a testvector
file and use it to stimulate and test a design via FLI function calls.

The files are organized as follows:

expected_results    Test results that should be seen in the transcript
                    after running vsim.

runtest.aix         A script to run the test on the 32-bit IBM RS6000 platform.

runtest.bat         A script to run the test in a DOS shell on the Windows
                    platform.

runtest.hp64        A script to run the test on the 64-bit HP-UX platform.

runtest.hpu         A script to run the test on the 32-bit HP-UX platform.

runtest.lnx         A script to run the test on the 32-bit Linux platform.

runtest.rs64        A script to run the test on the 64-bit IBM RS6000 platform.

runtest.ss5         A script to run the test on the 32-bit Sun Solaris platform.

runtest.ss5v9       A script to run the test on the 64-bit Sun Solaris platform.

runtest.win         A script to run the test in an MKS shell on the Windows
                    platform.

runtest_win.do      A do file to run the test from a ModelSim command line
                    on the Windows platform.

test_circuit.vhd    The VHDL testbed for testing a bidirectional transceiver.

tester.c            FLI code that reads a stimulus/response test vector file
                    and stimulates and tests the design attached to the ports
                    of its foreign architecture.

tester.exports      An export file to export symbols from tester.c for the
                    IBM platform.

tester.vhd          The VHDL foreign architecture for the tester implemented
                    in tester.c.

vectors             Test vectors for testing a bidirectional transceiver.

vsim.do             A vsim dofile to run the simulation and display results.

xcvr.vhd            A VHDL model of a transceiver.

NOTE: Each runtest script should be edited to run the appropriate
      compiler and linker for your system and to point to your
      modeltech installation for the include files.
